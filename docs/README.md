# FAQ
**Why does this need to use the Audio Plugin?**

It's the simplest way to do it. AFAIK editing the weapon sounds directly (if that's even possible since they're in the weapon files with stats) would lead to autodefenestration. Perhaps there's a way to do it like ZipIt by finding the actual audio playing functions but I don't have much time to be digging that much nowadays.
